# vsphere-cli

Many companies often find themselves compelled to persist with legacy software to fulfill specific requirements. A prime illustration of such legacy software is the vsphere-cli version 5.5 tool. However, a challenge arises as this tool relies on outdated libraries exclusively found in older operating systems. In this regard, Docker offers a solution by facilitating the rapid and straightforward creation of instances of legacy operating systems.

The provided Dockerfile offers a configuration for running vsphere-cli version 5.5 on Ubuntu 16. Additionally, a script accompanies it to execute the vsphere tool.
